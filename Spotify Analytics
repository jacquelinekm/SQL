-For this project I downloaded data from Kaggle:

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )


-What song has the highest popularity & danceability?

SELECT track_name, 
MAX(popularity) AS popularity, 
MAX (danceability) AS danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;


-Which 3 songs have the highest popularity, danceability, & energy?

SELECT track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY track_name
HAVING popularity > 90
AND danceability > '.50'
AND energy > '.50'
LIMIT 3;

-What is the average energy & tempo by track?

SELECT track_name, avg(energy) AS energy ,avg(tempo) AS tempo
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY track_name;
